            <p>This rule checks the usage of your variables and prevents common
            mistakes or enforces style conventions</p>

            <p>It can look for and report:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Undefined variables</li>
                <li>Unused variables and arguments (i.e. values that were
                    assigned to but never read)</li>
                <li>Arguments that shadow variables from an outer scope (due to
                    the scoping rules in coffeescript, these can <em>only</em>
                    be arguments)</li>
                <li>Variables that overwrite other variables from an outer
                    scope (due to the scoping rules in coffeescript, these can
                    <em>never</em> be arguments)</li>

                    This influences all the rules defined by this module as it
                    injects global variables within a file's scope.  The
                    default is <samp>["builtin"]</samp> which includes all es3
                    globals</dd>

                <dt><code>globals</code></dt>
                <dd>An object where keys are variable names and values are
                    booleans. A value of true means that said variable is
                    visible in all global scopes and can be assigned to, while
                    a value of false means that the variable is read-only and a
                    warning will be issued whenever it's written to. This
                    influences all the rules defined by this module as it
                    injects global variables within a file's scope. Defaults to
                    an empty object: <samp>{}</samp>.</dd>

                <dt><code>overwrite</code></dt>
                <dd>A boolean representing whether to warn when assigning to a
                    variable that was defined in a parent scope. Because
                    coffeescript lacks a `let` statement, assigning to a
                    variable will only create a new variable if there are no
                    matching variables of the same name in the current scope.
                    This rule allows you to discourage code that relies on this
                    and prevents unintentional occurences. The default value is
                    <samp>true</samp> meaning assigning variables from an outer
                    scope will issue a warning / error.

                <dt><code>same_scope</code></dt>
                <dd>A boolean representing whether to warn a variable is
                    modified regardless of the scope it was defined in,
                    effectively preventing reference mutation. In this regard,
                    it forces all variables to behave similarly to the
                    <code>const</code> keyword in ES6+. Defaults to
                    <samp>false</samp>.</dd>

                <dt><code>shadow</code></dt>
                <dd>A boolean value that specifies whether shadowing existing
                    variables is accepted or not. This rule behaves similarly
                    to `overwrite`, but it only affects function arguments, as
                    that's the only mechanism provided by coffeescript that can
                    shadow variables without overwriting them. Defaults to
                    <samp>true</samp></dd>

                <dt><code>shadow_builtins</code></dt>
                <dd>A boolean value that specifies whether shadowing of builtin
                    global variables (as defined by <code>environments</code>
                    and <code>globals</code>) is accepted or not. Due to the
                    way coffeescript's scopes work, assigning to such a global
                    will not overwrite it; it will instead create a new
                    variable in the current scope that will shadow it. Defaults
                    to <samp>false</samp> because some browser builtins are
                    extremely generic: <samp>name</samp>, <samp>status</samp>
                </dd>

                <dt><code>shadow_exceptions</code></dt>
                <dd>A list of regular expressions that further customizes the
                    behavior of <code>shadow</code> by allowing one or more
                    names to be exempt from shadowing warnings. The default
                    value is <samp>["err", "next"]</samp> to allow nesting of
                    Node.JS-style continuations. To be skipped, the name must
                    match the entire expression:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <samp>"ba."</samp>
                            will match
                                <code>"bar"</code> and
                                <code>"baz"</code>
                            but not
                                <code>"bard"</code> or
                                <code>"foobar"</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <samp>"ba.*"</samp>
                            will match
                                <code>"ba"</code> and
                                <code>"bar"</code> and
                                <code>"bard"</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </dd>

                <dt><code>undefined</code></dt>
                <dd>A boolean value that specifies whether to raise a warning /
                    error in the event an undefined variable is accessed. The
                    default and <strong>highly recommended</strong> value is
                    <samp>true</samp>. To work around framework-specific
                    messages, use <code>environments</code> and / or
                    <code>globals</code> instead.</dd>

                <dt><code>hoist_local</code></dt>
                <dd>A boolean value that specifies whether to warn about
                    relying on variable hosting to the top of their scope. The
                    default value is <samp>true</samp> because of
                    coffeescript's semantics. Changing it to false will start
                    producing warnings whenever you attempt to access a local
                    variable before you first assigned to it. We recommend
                    switching this to <samp>false</samp> as it results in
                    easier to read code.</dd>

                <dt><code>hoist_parent</code></dt>
                <dd>Similar to <code>hoist_local</code>, but it allows
                    referencing a variable before it was defined, provided it
                    belongs to (is written in) a parent scope. The default
                    value is <samp>true</samp>.</dd>

                <dt><code>unused_variables</code></dt>
                <dd>A boolean value that specifies whether to show a message if
                    a variable is assigned to but its value is never read.</dd>

                <dt><code>unused_arguments</code></dt>
                <dd>A boolean value that specifies whether to raise a warning /
                    error whenever a function argument is never read. Note that
                    arguments behave like variables for all intents and
                    purposes other than scoping and will respect any and all
                    <code>overwrite</code> and <code>shadow</code> rules and
                    exceptions.</dd>

                <dt><code>unused_classes</code></dt>
                <dd>A boolean value that specifies whether to raise a warning /
                    error whenever a class is defined but never used. Classes
                    that are part of an assignment statement never trigger
                    this warning. Defaults to <samp>true</samp> because of
                    historical reasons and the low rate of false positives
                    generated on most codebases.</dd>

                <dt><code>unused_exceptions</code></dt>
                <dd>A list of regular expressions that further customizes the
                    behavior of <code>unused_</code> by allowing one or more
                    names to be exempt from unused warnings. The default value
                    is <samp>["_.+"]</samp> to skip names starting with
                    underscores. To be skipped, the name must match the entire
                    expression:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <samp>"ba."</samp>
                            will match

                            but not
                                <code>"bard"</code> or
                                <code>"foobar"</code>.
